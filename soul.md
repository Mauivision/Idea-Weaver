# soul.md — Idea Weaver

This is the soul of Idea Weaver. Not the feature list. Not the roadmap. The *why* and the *who*.

## What We Are

We are a **place where ideas are safe**.

Not a productivity system. Not a task manager. Not a tool for people who already have it together.

We are the thing you reach for when a thought shows up — in the shower, on the job site, at 2am, mid-conversation — and you just need to **put it somewhere before it disappears**.

We believe:
- **Every idea deserves to exist.** The half-formed one. The weird one. The "probably nothing" one.
- **Capturing is enough.** You don't have to organize it right now. You don't have to act on it today.
- **Friction is the enemy.** One extra tap, one login screen, one moment of confusion — and the idea is gone forever.
- **The idea belongs to you.** Not to an algorithm. Not to a cloud you don't control. Not to a company monetizing your thoughts.

## Our Values

| Value | What it means here |
|-------|---------------------|
| **Zero friction** | Open the app. Speak or type. Done. Nothing should stand between the human and the blank page. |
| **No judgment** | We don't sort your ideas into good and bad. We don't show you what you haven't done. We hold what you give us, without opinion. |
| **Yours to keep** | Local first. Export anytime. No account required to start. Your ideas don't live on our servers by default — they live with you. |
| **Quiet intelligence** | The AI is there when you want it — to organize, summarize, connect. But it never jumps in uninvited. You are in charge. |
| **For everyone** | The contractor. The student. The parent. The artist. The person who's never called themselves a creative in their life. If you have thoughts, this is for you. |

## Who We Serve

The person driving to work who has an idea and can't write it down.
The kid in class who thinks of something and has nowhere to put it.
The entrepreneur who fills napkins and loses them.
The tradesperson whose best ideas come at the job site, not at a desk.
The grandparent who wants to remember the story they just thought of.
The anyone who ever said *"I had a great idea earlier and now I can't remember it."*

We are not for power users who want 47 features.
We are not for people who want to build a second brain.
We are for the person who just wants to **get the thought down** — quickly, safely, without worrying about doing it right.

## What We Don't Do

- We don't ask you to log in before you can write.
- We don't require you to pick a category before saving.
- We don't show you a blank onboarding survey before you capture your first idea.
- We don't make you feel behind for having unorganized notes.
- We don't push you to upgrade before you've felt the value.
- We don't make the AI the star. The idea is the star. The person who had it is the star.

## The Tone

When Idea Weaver speaks — in buttons, in prompts, in confirmations — it sounds like:

- **Calm** — never urgent, never pushy. A steady hand, not a hype machine.
- **Warm** — like a friend who says *"good, you wrote it down."*
- **Brief** — we don't explain ourselves. We just work.
- **Encouraging without being fake** — we don't confetti every tap. But when something is captured, we notice. *Saved. It's safe now.*

---

## The Role of AI

The AI in Idea Weaver is a **quiet helper, not a loud feature**.

It's there when you ask:
- *Summarize this for me.*
- *Rewrite this so I can send it.*
- *These three ideas feel related — help me see how.*
- *What should I do with all of this?*

It is never there to:
- Judge what you wrote.
- Rewrite something you didn't ask it to touch.
- Turn your raw thought into something polished before you're ready.
- Replace the act of thinking with the act of prompting.

The AI serves the idea. The idea serves the person. That's the order.

## The Soul in One Line

**Idea Weaver exists so that no good thought — no matter how small, unfinished, or unexpected — ever gets lost again.**

---

## How to Use This File

- **Before adding a feature:** Ask — *does this make it easier to capture, or does it add friction?* If it adds friction without clear payoff, cut it.
- **When writing UI copy:** Read it aloud. Is it calm? Brief? Does it sound like someone who's got your back?
- **When the AI does something:** Ask — *did the user ask for this?* If not, it shouldn't have happened.
- **When you're not sure what to build next:** Come back to "who we serve." Build for that person.

*This file can grow. The soul of Idea Weaver doesn't change on a whim — but it deepens as we learn who we're really for. Edit when something true belongs here. Keep it honest.*
